A database must be able to inhibit inconsistency occurring due to incorrect data. It must have certain identified attributes in relations to uniquely distinguish the tuples. No two tuples in a relation should have same value for all attributes since it will lead to duplicity of data. duplicity of data leads to inconsistency . Relational database systems have the concept of Relational Keys to distinguish between different records.
